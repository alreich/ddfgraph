# ddfgraph
This is a Python 2.7 prototype of the *Data Description Framework (DDF)*.

It draws heavily on the RDF-like code found in the most excellent book, "Programming the Semantic Web" (1st ed.), O'Reilly Media, Inc., by Toby Segaran, Colin Evans, and Jamie Taylor 2009.  (PSW)

The example "biz" data was taken from PSW.
